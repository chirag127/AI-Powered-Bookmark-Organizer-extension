##### Key Features

The extension will include the following core features, leveraging AI for automation:

1. **Automatic Categorization and Tagging**:
   - The extension analyzes bookmark content (e.g., title, URL, and page text) using Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite to assign relevant categories and tags.
   - For example, a bookmark to a tech article might be tagged "Technology" and "AI."
   - Users can customize or add to these categories and tags to suit their preferences, ensuring flexibility.

2. **Content Suggestion**:
   - Based on the user's existing bookmarks, the extension suggests related content (e.g., articles, resources) that may be of interest.
   - This feature uses AI to analyze bookmark metadata and recommend similar web pages, enhancing discovery.
   - For instance, if a user saves a bookmark on climate change, the extension might suggest recent reports or related studies.

3. **Archiving Old Bookmarks**:
   - The extension identifies bookmarks that haven't been accessed for a user-defined period (e.g., 6 months) and moves them to an archive.
   - Users can set archiving rules, such as the time threshold or specific folders to exclude from archiving, providing control.
   - This feature helps declutter the bookmark bar, improving usability.

4. **Search and Filter**:
   - Users can search for bookmarks using keywords, categories, or tags, making it easy to locate specific saved pages.
   - Filtering options allow users to narrow down their bookmark list by date added, last accessed, or custom criteria, enhancing efficiency.

5. **Customization**:
   - Users can create custom categories, tags, and archiving rules to personalize their bookmark organization.
   - The extension remembers user preferences and applies them consistently across sessions, improving user experience.
